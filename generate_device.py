generate_device.py
==================

Builds ``MuseEditor.amxd`` - a Max for Live MIDI-effect device that is a full
graphical editor for the Moog Muse.  The tabs follow the synth's own front-panel
layout and signal flow so it reads like the hardware:

    OSC | MIX | FILTER | ENV | VCA | MOD | LFO | DELAY | ARP | VOICE | BANK | MISC

All 102 CC-addressable parameters are exposed as Ableton-automatable controls,
drawn to mirror the matching front-panel control:

    knob / bipolar  -> live.dial    (rotary knobs)
    vert / horiz    -> live.slider  (mixer + ADSR faders, osc wave-mix faders)
    toggle          -> live.toggle  (sends 0 / 127)
    multistate      -> live.menu    (sends the centre value of the CC band)

Every control carries an `annotation`/`hint` (Moog descriptions + CC number),
so hovering shows what it does in Live's Info View, and a small INIT patch is
applied via parameter defaults so a freshly loaded device starts on a sound.

The whole UI fits inside Live's fixed 169-pixel device height: knob ("grid")
tabs stack their controls in up to two compact rows grouped like the panel
(OSC 1 over OSC 2, Filter 1 over Filter 2, ...), while the slider ("rack") tabs
(MIX, ENV) show a single row of tall faders.  Only the active tab is visible
(live.tab + thispatcher script show/hide, with per-tab scripting-name lists
generated here so they cannot drift out of sync with the objects).  The Bank
tab holds Program Change; the Misc tab holds Panic and (bidirectional) Pitch
Bend.  Both
Muse timbres are controlled by running one device instance per Ableton track on
different MIDI channels (Multi Mode); Live's per-track MIDI To remaps the output.

Outbound: every control -> [scale] -> prepend <cc> -> midiformat -> midiout.
Inbound (bidirectional): one [ctlin <cc>] per control writes the value back
with a `set` message, so turning a knob on the Muse updates the on-screen
control without retransmitting.  Notes pass through midiin -> midiout.

The ``.amxd`` binary container (ampf/meta/ptch + mx@c/dlst) is written to the
format Ableton's maxdevtools produces (ported from the js2max writer).
